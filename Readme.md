### Contents from [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) - prof.Andrew Ng, Stanford Uni

This lecture is composed of 5 lectures. Each lecture has video, Quiz, Programming assignments.
It is an ongoing class and there is a copyright problem, so I will select and upload the contents.

Most slides and pics are from [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) + My summary and pics
