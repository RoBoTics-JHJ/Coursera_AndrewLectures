# Introduction to Deep Learning

### 1. what does the analogy "AI is the new electricity" refer to?
- [ ] AI runs on computers and is thus powered by electricity, but it is letting computers do things not possible before.
- [x] Similar to electricity starting about 100 years ago, AI is transforming multiple industries.
- [ ] AI is powering personal devices in our homes and offices, similar to electricity.
- [ ] Through the “smart grid”, AI is delivering a new wave of electricity. 

### 2. Which of these are reasons for Deep Learning recently taking off? (Check the three options that apply.)
- [x] We have access to a lot more computational power.
- [x] Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition.
- [ ] Neural Networks are a brand new field.
- [x] We have access to a lot more data.

### 3. Recall this diagram of iterating over different ML ideas. Which of the statements below are true? (Check all that apply.)

</p>

- [ ] It is faster to train on a big dataset than a small dataset.
- [x] Faster computation can help speed up how long a team takes to iterate to a good idea.
- [x] Being able to try out ideas quickly allows deep learning engineers to iterate more quickly.
- [x] Recent progress in deep learning algorithms has allowed us to train good models faster (even without changing the CPU/GPU hardware). 

### 4. When an experienced deep learning engineer works on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
- False
### 5. Which one of these plots represents a ReLU activation function?

</p>

### 6. Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
- False
### 7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
- False
### 8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
- [ ] RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....
- [x] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
- [x] It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
- [ ] It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

### 9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" height="60%" src="https://github.com/RoBoTics-JHJ/Coursera_AndrewLectures/blob/main/1st_Nerual%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/1_Introduction%20to%20deep%20learning/C1W1_Q_image/9.png">
</p>

- x-axis is the amount of data

- y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

### 10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
- [ ] Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [ ] Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [x] Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [x] Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
